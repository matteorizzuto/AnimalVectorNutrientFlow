# Animal-Vectored Nutrient Flow in Meta-ecosystems

This repository contains the code to replicate the numerical analyses of the model presentence in Rizzuto et al. _Animal-vectored nutrient flow along different resource gradients influences the nature of local and meta-ecosystem functioning_.
Here is a breakdown of the files contained in this repository:

* _SupportingCode.Rmd_, this R markdown notebook contains the entire code to replicate the numerical analyses of the model and produce the figures in the manuscript.
* _Rizzuto_SupportingCode.bib_, this bibtex file contains the references cited in the R markdown notebook.
